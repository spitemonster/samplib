# SMPLB

an open-source web based sample library tool

## install and run

requires a running postgres db and set up in `.env`. running the server (for now) clears and re-initializes db. i'm not sure how this information is typically communicated so i will do some research and update this eventually.

`npm install` then `npm run dev`
project runs at `localhost:process.env.PORT || 3000`
